That sounds like a very interesting and interactive way to visualize a Kanban board! Here's a rough idea of how it might look:

1. **Dashboard Layout**: The dashboard would be divided into several horizontal sections, each representing a column on the Kanban board. The sections would be stacked vertically, with the leftmost column of the Kanban board at the bottom and the rightmost at the top.

2. **Task Bubbles**: Within each section, tasks would be represented as bubbles. The size of the bubble could potentially represent the size or complexity of the task. Each bubble would contain a brief description of the task, and perhaps other details like due date or assignee.

3. **Pools**: Each section would contain one or more pools, representing groups of tasks with the same tag. The pools could be visually distinguished by different colors or patterns.

4. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Users would be able to click and drag the task bubbles from one section to another, effectively moving tasks between columns on the Kanban board. As tasks are moved up the sections, they would move closer to the top of the dashboard, visualizing the progress of tasks from left to right on the Kanban board.

5. **Reverse Funnel Effect**: The visual effect of dragging tasks up the sections would resemble a reverse funnel, with tasks starting at the wide bottom and moving towards the narrow top as they progress.

Remember, this is just a rough visualization. The actual design would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
